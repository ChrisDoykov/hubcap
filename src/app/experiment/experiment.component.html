        The EXPERIMENT calls provide €30,000 to €75,000 to support a consortium
        of two SMEs to experiment with the adoption of Model-Based Design for
        Cyber-Physical Systems using assets and services from the platform, in
        particular from SMEs with less prior digital experience. Funding

        Who are we looking for?

      <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
        HUBCAP is currently looking for two-SME consortia wanting to adopt and
        experiment with MBD tools for CPSs, with the goal of increasing the
        outreach and adoption of MBD and CPS technologies by providing funding
        and services for the deployment of MBD CPS products/services.

        How does Call #2 EXPERIMENT work?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
        Each EXPERIMENT call will fund consortia of two SMEs, namely one
        user/adopter SME and one provider SME, to experiment with MBD either by
        integrating the HUBCAP ecosystem offers or implementing in a new MBD CPS
        solution. Experiments should support user/adopter SMEs who are less
        familiar with MBD for CPS to learn and experiment with these techniques,
        supported by the provider SME. Experiments should address a clear
        business need for the user/adopter SME in terms of improving the
        lifecycle process or design of CPS for example through visual
        prototyping or simulation of models.

          The PULL call aims to attract and engage Europeans SMEs/midcaps to
          join and integrate existing Model-Based Design tools into the HUBCAP
          Collaboration Platform. However, there may be MBD tools developed by
          other organisations who are not eligible for PULL funding but would be
          a valuable addition to the platform and ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
          In the spirit of openness, HUBCAP is accepting applications from
          organisations offering MBD tools who are not eligible for PULL
          funding.

          Applications are subject to the same evaluation criteria as for PULL
          calls, to screen applications for appropriateness and quality. By
          filling in the form, it is not guaranteed that your asset will be
          listed.

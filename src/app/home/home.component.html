        <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
          Cyber-Physical Systems are systems that link the physical world (e.g.,
          through sensors or actuators) with the digital world of software
          systems and communications technology. A CPS will often include
          components from many different providers, so your business may already
          be contributing towards CPSs. <br />

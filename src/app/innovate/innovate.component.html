      <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
        HUBCAP is seeking highly-innovative collaborations of 2-3 SMEs, that
        will work together to create tools, develop and deploy innovative CPS
        products and solutions using MBD, with the goal of developing new CPS
        technologies and enlarging the value and outreach of the HUBCAP
        Ecosystem.

        How does Call #3 INNOVATE work?
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
        The INNOVATE call will fund 10 innovation projects composed by a
        consortia of 2–3 SMEs representing at least one provider SME and one
        adopter SME, that will work towards the development and implementation
        of highly innovative and challenging MBD CPS solutions, which will
        become part of the HUBCAP portfolio of success stories. The INNOVATE
        call projects will have a total duration of 12 months divided in three
        stages: Design, Develop & Operate, Assess. At the end of each phase,
        each consortium must deliver a report in which they will show their
        progress and milestones achieved. HUBCAP will provide technology and
        business support to assure the highest impact possible for each project.
        The expected outcome will be 10 innovative Application Experiments (AEs)
        by European SMEs, demonstrating the value and benefits of HUBCAP MBD CPS
        technologies in different industry environments.

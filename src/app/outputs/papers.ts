      "Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, aiming to start up in Model-Based Design (MBD) face difficult choices from a wide range of methods, notations and tools before making the significant investments in planning, procurement and training necessary to deploy new approaches successfully. In the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) this is exacerbated by the diversity of formalisms covering computation, physical and human processes. In this paper, we propose the use of a cloud-enabled and open collaboration platform that allows businesses to offer models, tools and other assets, and permits others to access these on a pay-per-use basis as a means of lowering barriers to the adoption of MBD technology, and to promote experimentation in a sandbox environment.",

    summary:
      "The 18th in the “Overture” series of workshops on the Vienna Development Method (VDM), its associated tools and applications, was held online, on 7th December 2020. VDM is one of the longest established formal methods, and yet has a lively community of researchers and practitioners in academia and industry grown around the modelling languages (VDM-SL, VDM++, VDM-RT) and tools (VDMTools, VDMJ, ViennaTalk, Overture, Crescendo, Symphony, and the INTO-CPS chain). Together, these provide a platform for work on modelling and analysis technology that includes static and dynamic analysis, test generation, execution support, and model checking. Research in VDM and Overture is driven by the need to develop industry practice as well as fundamental theory. The 18th Workshop reflected the breadth and depth of work supporting and applying VDM. In this technical report, we include two technical sessions with papers. The first session consists of three papers associated with tool building and cloud computing systems, and the second consists of two papers on co-simulation and Cyber-Physical Systems. As a consequence of the pandemic that gripped the world in 2020, this was the first Overture Workshop to be conducted entirely online. Thinking back over the 17 previous times on which we had shared our meetings, as well as hospitality, in person in locations around the world, this was a bittersweet event. It was bitter in the sense that we were separated from colleagues and friends, and that pressures of other tasks had kept the contributions to a minimum. At the same time, it was a great pleasure to share a few hours again with colleagues and friends with whom we have, over decades, come to share scientific interests and enthusiasms. We would like to thank the authors, PC members, reviewers and participants for their help in making this a valuable and successful workshop, and we look forward together to meeting once more in a safer world in 2021.",

    summary:
      "We describe a pilot study that aims to evaluate a systematic approach to tuning the design parameters of Cyber-Physical Systems by using machine-assisted Design Space Exploration supported by the INTO-CPS Toolchain. The study focuses on the design of a modified controller for a semi-autonomous agricultural robot. Beginning from a candidate multi-model built from VDM and 20-sim, the study uses data derived from test runs of the robot to tune selected parameters of a Continuous-Time model of the robot’s physics in order to improve fidelity. The study raises questions around support for the selection of parameters for tuning, selection of test scenarios, and the ranking of results. We identify further work to complete the design loop by assessing the consequences of introducing a modified controller and deploying it in further field tests.",

    summary:
      "Our world is evolving very rapidly, both from the technological point of view – with impressive advances in artificial intelligence and new hardware challenging longstanding PC hardware traditions, for example – and as a result of unexpected events. The year 2020 was quite exceptional, an annus horribilis, according to some. It is hard to disagree with this statement, but every dark cloud has a silver lining. 2020 was also the year that accelerated digital transformation beyond what could have been imagined in 2019. Vaccine development happened faster than would ever have been conceivable a year ago, digital payment became the norm for many people and e-commerce and online sales threatened brick and mortar shops. Employees were encouraged to work from home – with its advantages and disadvantages, videoconferencing became the de facto way to interact with both family and colleagues, schools were forced to experiment with distance learning. Thee list goes on. A#er living for over a year in an online world, most people will not return completely to the “old normal”. They will go for a combination of the “old normal” and things they discovered and experimented with in the circumstances forced upon us by COVID-19; they might keep their home once on some days, and be in the workplace on other days. Higher education will certainly also continue to offer online teaching. The rapidly evolving digital world has also had an impact on the HiPEAC Vision: updating it every two years no longer seems quite in keeping with the speed of the evolution of computing systems. Therefore, we decided to move from producing a large roadmap document every other year, to an agile, rapidly evolving electronic magazine-like set of articles. The HiPEAC Vision 2021 has two main parts: • A set of recommendations for the HiPEAC community. It will also introduce the second part of the Vision and will be updated periodically, or on particular occasions. • A set of “articles”, like in magazines, that will be regularly updated, the purpose of which is to support the set of recommendations, or to introduce new topics or situations. This will guarantee that the HiPEAC Vision keeps evolving and remains up to date. These articles are intended to be self-sufficient and can be read independently. They are grouped into four themes or dimensions: technical, business, societal and European. New articles will be added over the course of the years (and outdated ones might be removed). A further element of this new approach to the Vision is that the editorial board asked and will ask various authors to contribute to those articles. This adds heterogeneity and a diversity of point of view that could be helpful for better analysis of the computing systems landscape as well as improve the quality of the recommendations. The HiPEAC Vision will be available on the HiPEAC website, with easy access to each article. You will also fnd a “consolidated” version of the Vision, similar to the previous versions, and incorporating all the current articles. This consolidated version will also be printed and distributed like the previous ones.",

      "In this work, we present the initial steps in the development of a digital twin of the agricultural autonomous vehicle, Robotti. A model of the vehicle dynamics is initially developed in the open-source multi-physics code, Chrono, and then wrapped as a Functional Mock-up Unit. We provide an overview of the envisioned digital twin system and a description of currently implemented features. The dynamic system of the vehicle chassis is characterised by the implementation of a revolute joint that ensures wheel–surface contact in uneven terrain. The vehicle dynamics model is applied for testing two scenarios describing the loads on the vehicle as a consequence of this mechanism. Finally, we give pointers to future work on modelling the Robotti and the establishment of a digital twin.",

    summary:
      "A digital twin for a Cyber-Physical System includes a simulation model that predicts how a physical system should behave. We show how to quantify and characterise violation events for a given safety property for the physical system. The analysis uses the digital twin to inform a runtime monitor that checks whether the noise and violations observed fall within expected statistical distributions. The results allow engineers to determine the best system configuration through what-if analysis. We illustrate our approach with a case study of an agricultural vehicle.",

    summary:
      "Model-based design of manufacturing robotic systems involving the usage of different tools, models and the co-simulation of the system behaviour benefits from collaborative platforms enabling ready-to-use and cloud-hosted tools and models. Nonetheless, due to market segmentation and the difficulty to deploy and support all the existing tools and models in such a platform, it is, therefore, reasonable to consider a hybrid cloud-setup where some tools run in the public cloud and other are only available in private clouds or dedicated machines behind the walls of the licensed institution. In this paper, we report on a experiment of such scenario, where a Matlab/SimulinkTM, LS-Dyna, and Model. CONNECTTM powered co-simulation tool suite running in a private cloud is combined with the DDD Simulation tool running inside a public cloud. Due to this setup it was possible to combine a 1D hot stamping process simulation with a 3D visualisation. Finally the results of the process simulation were improved by considering realistic movement of the robot. Our study elicited several limitations and feature requests that need to be addressed to better support a hybrid cloud setup for model-based design practitioners. We expect this initial contribution to trigger ground breaking research encompassing all the community members interested in hybrid co-simulation setups.",

The early prediction of avalanches now relies on a sustained collection of data and implementation experience. Among the main challenges are the local specific landform, or weather features. The article highlights the need for avalanche warning systems. Next, the existing databases are presented, based on different geographical location. We also describe the functional and experimental avalanche prediction systems. The article makes a comprehensive description of what exists in technical terms related to the existing avalanche warning systems.",

          HUBCAP has just launched the first Open Call #1.1 - PULL: we are now
          looking for European SMEs providing CPS and MBD assets & tools. Such
          digital technologies may be applied to any sector domain (Mobility,
          Industry, Health, Energy, Environment, Robotics, etc.), to enrich our
          innovative and sustainable cloud-based open collaboration platform!
          Applications to Call #1.1 are open until 30 June at 17h00 CEST.

        </h2>

        <p class="paragraph paragraph--big">
          Each PULL call provides a mini-grant of €1,000 to help individual SMEs
          integrate existing CPS and MBD tools in the HUBCAP collaboration
          platform. The asset integration is supported by the DIHs through the
          participation in workshops. SMEs are invited to define the price
          structure for their assets and will thus benefit from exposure in the
          HUBCAP marketplace, as well as the opportunity to find new customers
          and participate in the subsequent EXPERIMENT and INNOVATE calls.

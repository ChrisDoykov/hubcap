    summary:
      "Many European countries have dense road networks and significant traffic problems. The flow of traffic on Europeâ€™s roads is managed by a series of traffic management systems that are owned and controlled by various local and national authorities. A traffic management system (TMS) consists of a collection of digital control systems linked to physical devices installed along the roadside. These can be sensors that collect traffic data (such as cameras, radar detection systems, and induction loops) or actuators that are used as control measures by giving instructions to road users through signs and signals. Existing traffic management solutions are run centrally from regional control centres. While cooperation between various road authorities at a governance level has improved recently, technical barriers for collaborative and distributed traffic management systems over regional borders must still be removed. The TEMPO experiment aimed to tackle this problem by providing collaborative, distributed control architectures for traffic management systems that engage with each other in automated negotiation. The negotiations are targeted to find control measures that optimise traffic flow cross-border and for the traffic network as a whole. The  experiment  applied  an  existing  modelling  and  simulation  platform  called  Overture  for  TMSs.  Models  can  demonstrate the correctness and benefits of designs prior to costly implementation. Traffic simulations produce a large amount of numerical data that need to be interpreted and presented in an understandable way to non-IT experts. The existing Overture technology has been extended with 2D/3D visualisation to illustrate the effect of the automated negotiations on the traffic flow.",

      'In the Cyber Security market there are a lot of tools for various operations and the end-user needs to select two or more tools based on their requirements. Having this in mind Cyberarch Consulting came up with an idea of creating a single product that can serve as an all-purpose tool. RCADE which is being developed as an "All in one Security Solution". It integrates Vulnerability Assessment, Log Analysis, Malware Analysis, Security Monitoring, OSINT Gathering, Hybrid Pentest Request. as one product. Moreover, the tool is available in the cloud such as AWS, Azure, Alibaba and deployable on premises. The tool is built in such a way that even a novice user can easily use it efficiently without prior training/knowledge.',

      "The fortissimo rover shows how model-based systems engineering can be employed to design, validate and transfer software and system architectures for autonomous vehicles to an operational cyber-physical system. The fortissimo platooning model was implemented in the AutoFOCUS3 open source systems engineering tool developed by fortiss. It represents an autonomous driving function that permits automobiles or trucks to drive behind one another at extremely close distances, thus reducing fuel consumption. The model provides the logical architecture and the behaviour specification of platooning functions such as joining or leaving a platoon and car-to-car communication, as well as ADAS functions like adaptive cruise control systems and lane/emergency braking assistants. The developed functions can be implemented via code generators in the physical fortissimo Rover, a 1:10 scale model vehicle equipped with sensor technology such as cameras, ultrasound and laser-based distance meters. The virtual fortissimo platform is intended of the early validation of the models in a functional simulation environment. By means of the AutoFOCUS3 FMI interface, the vehicle behavior is co-simulated with the vehicle dynamics and the environment (modeled using other open source tools such as OpenModelica, ROS and Gazebo) and represented in a 3D simulation. At fortiss, the fortissimos are used to examine current research issues. These include a model-based method for deriving so-called assurance cases for validating the functional safety of the vehicles in line with ISO-26262, degradation and reconfiguration strategies for safeguarding critical driving functions (e.g., against hardware faults), analytical and simulation-based processes for dimensioning and validating the vehicle hardware and software architecture (i.e, design-space exploration such as HW/SW deployments).",

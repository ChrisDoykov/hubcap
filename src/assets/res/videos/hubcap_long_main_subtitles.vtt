1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
Systems that collect physical information from the real world using sensors,

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.720
process it digitally, and effect physical changes

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.840
are increasingly important in today’s world.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.160
These so-called Cyber-Physical Systems are found everywhere

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.640
from electric vehicles to smart cities,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.280
and from smart manufacturing

7
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.560
to precision agriculture.

8
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.920
Model-based design and simulation are often used

9
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.200
to build Cyber-Physical Systems efficiently

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.840
but for small- and medium-sized companies,

11
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.080
investing in such technology can be complex and expensive.

12
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.720
Seven Digital Innovation Hubs have joined forces

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.760
to create HUBCAP,

14
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.760
a European Union-funded project

15
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.000
which aims to help SMEs use model-based design

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.920
to make it easier and more cost-effective to develop Cyber-Physical Systems.

17
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.560
HUBCAP has a €3.2 million fund to help SMEs

18
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.240
experiment and innovate with digital technologies.

19
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.440
The funding is allocated in three levels of open call.

20
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.040
The PULL open calls offer €1,000

21
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.760
to integrate existing models of Cyber-Physical Systems and model-based design tools

22
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.960
into the HUBCAP collaboration platform,

23
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.080
giving you access to our community and new markets.

24
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.880
The EXPERIMENT call offers between €30,000 and €75,000

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.320
to help consortia of two SMEs

26
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.000
as they try out and evaluate model-based design tools

27
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360
and services in a low-risk environment.

28
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.040
And the INNOVATE call provides up to €200,000

29
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.560
to consortia of two or three SMEs to develop new products and services

30
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.360
using model-based methods and tools from the HUBCAP platform.

31
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.000
If you don’t have a consortium,

32
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.040
join the HUBCAP webinars and online matchmaking events to find new partners.

33
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.000
Taking part in the HUBCAP project can help your business

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.840
introduce the technology it needs

35
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.760
to develop new and innovative products and services to meet today’s challenges…

36
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.880
and seize the opportunities.
